# CanPixel Realms

This is a Next.js application bootstrapped with `create-next-app`, using Firebase, Genkit, and ShadCN.

## Overview

This project is a personal portfolio and creative space for "Can Ur", a "Method Developer". It showcases a variety of projects, including games, music, and philosophical explorations. The website has a unique, mysterious, and rebellious aesthetic.

A key feature is the **Realms** section, a dynamic showcase of projects. Each project card has its own unique styling—from font and color to custom backgrounds and hover animations—turning each entry into a distinct "realm" for the visitor to discover.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Portfolio:** A filterable gallery of creative game projects. Each project card features unique, tailored styling that reflects its theme.
- **Detailed Project Pages:** Each project has its own detail page with in-depth descriptions, tech stacks, and links.
- **Comprehensive Music Page:** A dedicated page for music projects, separated into distinct, stylized sections for different bands and solo work, including embedded Spotify players.
- **Stylized About Page:** A professionally designed page with a dynamic hero section and an animated timeline outlining the developer's journey.
- **Custom Navigation:** A responsive navigation menu that appears on scroll, maintaining a clean aesthetic.

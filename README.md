# CanPixel Realms

This is a Next.js application bootstrapped with `create-next-app`, using Firebase, Genkit, and ShadCN.

## Overview

This project is a personal portfolio and creative space for "Can Ur", a "Method Developer". It showcases a variety of projects, including games, music, and philosophical explorations. The website has a unique, mysterious, and rebellious aesthetic, implemented with a custom-designed, text-based, vertical navigation menu.

The key features of this application are:
- **Portfolio:** A dynamic gallery of creative projects with unique, hover-animated styling for each project card.
- **Music:** A page dedicated to the band ZIGGURATH, with a music player and band bio.
- **About:** Information about Can Ur, presented as a timeline of his journey.
- **Contact:** A contact form that uses a Genkit AI flow to assess the suitability of client inquiries.
- **Unique Navigation:** A custom-built, responsive, text-based vertical sidebar navigation with animations.

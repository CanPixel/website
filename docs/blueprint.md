## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very dark gray (#1A1A1A) to provide a minimalistic and neutral backdrop, allowing project-specific realms to stand out. Desaturated to 20%.
- Primary color: Light blue (#94C4C4), an analogous hue to teal and magenta, evoking a futuristic-meets-occult feel. The subdued tone avoids the cliché of directly copying from the brand's accent colors, which are highly saturated.
- Accent color: Soft violet (#C494B3), analogous to the primary, to create contrast.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), lending a modern, somewhat techy feel suitable for headlines. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif).
- Minimalist glyph logo with occult undertones. Shifting guitar-string line and hand-drawn texture to be implemented using SVG, ensuring scalability for various sizes (favicon, header).
- Gentle shimmer animation and string vibration on logo hover, adding a subtle interactive element to the site.
- Project cards are to be displayed in a grid layout on the portfolio page, with each card dynamically adapting its realm-specific background, textures, and animations to provide a unique visual experience.
